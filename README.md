# rust-fibonacci

A Fibonacci calculator built in Rust. Runs in the terminal with feedback to the user.
Using the num-bigint crate it can calculate up to the 64000-th number in the Fibonacci sequence. Could probably extend this further, but this is the largest number that I have verified.

Error handles the user input and gives feedback. Option to try a new number or exit by writing 'exit'.

Double click the .exe file on windows or the binary-file on macOS to start the program in the terminal.
